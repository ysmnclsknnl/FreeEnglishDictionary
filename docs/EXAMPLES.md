# Examples

## 1. Counter

This is the simplest example of all examples in this repository. It features a counter that counts up and down when buttons are clicked and demonstrates the central theme of the Application Architecture: the Page/View/State model. It is discussed in detail in the main README [here](../README.md#32-code-example).

## 2. Pokemon

Folder: `src/examples/pokemons`

This example demonstrates how to fetch data from a Web API and show a loading indicator while the data is being fetched. It also shows how errors can be handled.

## 3. Currency Converter

Folder: `src/examples/currency-converter`

In this example we will show how to work with HTML input elements, such as \<select> and \<input> elements using the Page/View/State model.

## 4. Stopwatch

Folder: `src/examples/stopwatch`

This is a multi-page example that uses the Router. It demonstrates how the `pageWillUnload()` life cycle method can be used to clear an interval timer prior to leaving the page.

## 5. GitHub App

Folder: `src/examples/github`

This is a multi-page Router example that uses Observable State and URL parameters.

## 6. Nobel Prize

This multi-page Router example uses Observable State and dynamic route imports.
